# My Flutter Portfolio Projects

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my Flutter portfolio. These are some apps I've been working on to showcase my mobile development skills.

## 📱 Projects Overview

### 1. Todo App
A productivity app I built to help manage daily tasks. Started this one to learn state management with Provider.

**Features:**
- Add, edit, delete tasks
- Categories for organization
- Dark mode (because who doesn't love dark mode?)
- Local storage with SharedPreferences
- Search functionality
- Stats page to track productivity

**Tech:** Flutter, Provider, SharedPreferences

---

### 2. Weather App
Simple weather app with a clean UI. Wanted to practice working with API patterns and animations.

**Features:**
- Current weather display
- 5-day forecast
- Mock data for now (planning to add real API later)
- Nice gradients and cards
- Loading states

**Tech:** Flutter, Provider, Material Design

---

### 3. E-commerce App
Built this to show I can handle shopping app logic. Still adding features when I have time.

**Features:**
- Product browsing
- Shopping cart
- Product details
- Basic checkout flow
- Category filtering

**Tech:** Flutter, Provider, Navigation 2.0

---

### 4. Chat App
Messaging interface inspired by WhatsApp. Good practice for complex UIs.

**Features:**
- Chat list
- Message bubbles
- Online status indicators
- Typing indicators
- Mock conversations

**Tech:** Flutter, Provider, Custom widgets

## 🚀 Running the Apps

Each app can be run independently:

```bash
# Navigate to any app folder
cd todo_app
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

Or for web:
```bash
flutter run -d chrome
```

## 🛠 Development Setup

Make sure you have Flutter installed (I'm using 3.24.5).

```bash
flutter doctor
```

## 📝 Notes

- All apps use Provider for state management (keeping it simple)
- Focused on clean UI and smooth animations
- Mock data for most apps (easier for portfolio demos)
- Comments are minimal but code should be self-explanatory

## 🎯 Future Plans

- Add real weather API integration
- Implement Firebase for the chat app
- Add payment gateway to e-commerce
- More animations and micro-interactions
- Testing (I know, I should have done TDD...)
